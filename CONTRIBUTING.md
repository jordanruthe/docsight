# Contributing to DOCSight

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Before You Start

**Please open an issue first** before working on any new feature or significant change. This lets us discuss the approach and make sure it fits the project architecture. PRs without a prior issue may be closed.

This is especially important for:
- New features or modules
- Architectural changes
- Changes touching multiple files

Small bugfixes and typo corrections are fine without an issue.

## Architecture

DOCSight v2.0 uses a **modular collector-based architecture**. All data collection follows this pattern:

```
Collector Registry → Base Collector (Fail-Safe) → Analyzer/Storage → Web UI
```

**When contributing:**
- New data sources must implement the `Collector` base class
- New modem types must implement the `ModemDriver` base class (`app/drivers/base.py`)
- Collectors run in **parallel threads** via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Protect shared state with locks.
- Use the collector pattern for automatic fail-safe and health monitoring

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical documentation and data flow diagrams.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsDNNS/docsight.git
cd docsight
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest
```

## Docker Development

For a containerized dev environment:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

This runs on port **8767** (`http://localhost:8767`) in demo mode. Production uses `docker-compose.yml` on port 8765.

## Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

1100+ tests cover analyzers, collectors, drivers, event detection, API endpoints, config, MQTT, i18n, and PDF generation. All tests must pass before submitting a PR.

## Running Locally

```bash
python -m app.main
```

Open `http://localhost:8765` to access the setup wizard.

## Project Structure

```
app/
  main.py            - Entrypoint, ThreadPoolExecutor polling loop
  web.py             - Flask routes and API endpoints (thread-safe state)
  analyzer.py        - DOCSIS channel health analysis
  event_detector.py  - Signal anomaly detection (thread-safe)
  thresholds.json    - Configurable signal thresholds (VFKD guidelines)
  config.py          - Configuration management (env + config.json)
  storage/           - SQLite storage (base + mixins), WAL mode, thread-safe
  collectors/        - Collector implementations (modem, demo, speedtest, bqm)
    base.py          - Abstract Collector with fail-safe and locking
    __init__.py      - Registry and discover_collectors()
  drivers/           - Modem driver implementations (11 drivers)
    base.py          - Abstract ModemDriver interface
    registry.py      - Driver registry (auto-detection + manual selection)
  modules/           - Built-in modules (backup, bnetz, bqm, journal, mqtt, ...)
  blueprints/        - Flask blueprints (config, polling, data, analysis, ...)
  i18n/              - Translation files (EN/DE/FR/ES JSON)
  fonts/             - Bundled DejaVu fonts for PDF generation
  static/            - Static assets (icons, etc.)
  templates/         - Jinja2 HTML templates
tests/               - pytest test suite (1100+ tests)
docker-compose.yml     - Production Docker setup
docker-compose.dev.yml - Development Docker setup
```

## Internationalization (i18n)

Translations live in `app/i18n/` as JSON files:

- `en.json` — English
- `de.json` — German
- `fr.json` — French
- `es.json` — Spanish

Each file has a `_meta` field with `language_name` and `flag`. When adding or changing UI strings, update **all 4 files**.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **One PR per feature/fix.** Don't bundle unrelated changes.
- **Keep changes focused and minimal.** Smaller PRs are easier to review and more likely to be merged.
- **Follow the pipeline architecture.** New functionality must integrate into the existing data flow, not bypass it.
- Add tests for new functionality
- Maintain all 4 language translations (EN/DE/FR/ES) in `app/i18n/*.json`
- Run the full test suite before submitting a PR
- AI-generated bulk PRs without prior discussion will not be merged

## Building Modules

DOCSight supports community modules that extend functionality without modifying core code. Modules can add API endpoints, data collectors, settings panels, dashboard tabs, and more.

See the **[DOCSight Community Modules](https://github.com/itsDNNS/docsight-modules)** repository for the development guide, starter template, and submission process.

## Adding Modem Support

See the **[Adding Modem Support](https://github.com/itsDNNS/docsight/wiki/Adding-Modem-Support)** wiki page for the full guide, including raw data format, analyzer output reference, and wanted drivers.
